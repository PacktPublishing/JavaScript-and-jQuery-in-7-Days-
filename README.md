## About the Video Course
JavaScript is the language of the web. You can use it to add dynamic behaviors, store information, and handle requests and responses on a website on-the-fly and this is why it has become one of the most useful languages in the web development community.

In this course, you will instantly start to work with JavaScript, jQuery, and Bootstrap using the in-browser editor. You'll start off by learning the basics of JavaScript by writing your first program. After mastering the fundamentals, you'll learn how to write clean and maintainable JavaScript code. You'll be taught modern JavaScript at a quick pace to maximize your learning for the time available. Later you'll work with objects and arrays to model problems/solutions for better program output in JavaScript. You'll be creating an awesome-looking battleship game with slideshows, a development journal with YouTube, and image-embedded URLs with Bootstrap and jQuery.

Each lesson will begin by reviewing the exercise from the previous day, before moving on to the subject of that day's lesson. By the end of the course you will be amazed by everything you've managed to learn and accomplish in such a short time. Each lesson is inspiring and fun, making you feel like a magical code wizard!
